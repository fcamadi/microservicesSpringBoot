spring:
  application:
    name: RegistryService
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888           # where the config-service is running
      fail-fast: true                      # the service will not run if it can't reach the config-service
      username: admin                      # username of the config-service
      password: nimda                      # password of the config-service
